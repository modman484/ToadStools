Narrative: You're a delivery boy who needs to deliver a powerful cookbook to a certain benefactor,
probably find some interesting folks along the way too. 
Using "ls" and "cat [insert file name]" will be the two commmands you'll need to learn right now. 
You'll find more commands throughout the game. "ls" helps list what's in a directory (location), 
and "cat" will show you what's in files, and in this context, look at objects.
